title: Private Chains
---

OpenEthereum supports private chain and private network configuration via [Chain specification](Chain-specification) files provided with `--chain`. In addition to the usual [Proof of Work Chains](Proof-of-Work-Chains), OpenEthereum also includes [Proof of Authority Chains](Proof-of-Authority-Chains) which do not require mining.
More details on the available options can be found on the [Pluggable Consensus](Pluggable-Consensus) page.
