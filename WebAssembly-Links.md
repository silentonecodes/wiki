## Tutorial

- [Step-by-step tutorial](https://github.com/openethereum/pwasm-tutorial) deploying complex contract with abi, using Web3, etc.

## Contract examples

- [pwasm-token-example](https://github.com/openethereum/pwasm-token-example). ERC20 token in Rust.
- [pwasm-repo-contract](https://github.com/openethereum/pwasm-repo-contract). Simple REPO contract with some lending-borrowing logic in Rust, which uses ERC20 tokens.
